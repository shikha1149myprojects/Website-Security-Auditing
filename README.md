# Website Security Auditing

The following are some of the benefits of conducting a security audit on a website: 
1. Assess resistance to common security threats like brute force attacks, DDoS attacks, SQL injections, and cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. Spot vulnerabilities early to stop hackers from taking advantage of them.
3. Use access controls and encryption methods to safeguard data.
4. Verify adherence to relevant laws and industry guidelines.
