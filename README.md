# Website Security Auditing

The following are some of the benefits of conducting a security audit on a website: 
1. Assess resistance to common security threats like brute force attacks, DDoS attacks, SQL injections, and cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. Spot vulnerabilities early to stop hackers from taking advantage of them.
3. Use access controls and encryption methods to safeguard data.
4. Verify adherence to relevant laws and industry guidelines.

## Tools used
- Burp Suite Professional

Here, I have conducted security auditing of 2 websites using Burp Suite:

## Port Scan of Web Sever

Web servers can scan their ports for open and listening ports and security devices like firewalls. It can offer details about active services, users who own services, anonymous logins, and authentication needs. Unnecessary open ports can produce an extensive attack surfaceÂ for malevolent users. The results of port scans can be classified as filtered, closed, or open. This method assists in locating possible weak points and vulnerabilities.
